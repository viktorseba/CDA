    "Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used in chemistry \n",
    "as a rapid analytical method to obtain a snapshot representing the entire chemical \n",
    "complexity of a given sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present data describes FTIR spectra of milk samples which were measured time-resolved during an ongoing enzymatic reaction. A protease - an enzyme which is capable of degrading proteins - was added to each sample containing varying casein concentrations (a milk protein). As soon as the protease was injected FTIR spectra were acquired consecutively. Due to the enzyme activity the spectra started to change. The resulting spectral evolution represents the kinetic behavior of the enzymatic reaction monitored. Such spectral evolution profiles (eps) were acquired for each sample given different initial casein concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each evolution profile (ep) is represented as a $N \\times M$ data matrix with $N$ temporal time points (= number of spectra) and $M$ spectral wavenumbers. Some data pre-processing has been performed for all eps, i.e. the first spectrum of each ep was subtracted from each respective series. Hence, the spectral changes appear in reference to the initial spectrum at time point $0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to establish a suitable PARAFAC model which is capable of quantifying the initial casein concentration. No Cross-Validation should be performed, instead the entire data shall be considered in an unsupervised learning regime. \n",
