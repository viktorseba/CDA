    "Excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy is used in analytical chemistry to detect and quantify chemical constituents, e.g. amino acids. Such constituents typically absorb light in a certain spectral range (excitement) followed by the subsequent phenomena of light emission (fluorescence). Hereby, the emitted light may indicate different wavelengths than the light used for excitation.  \n",

    "This provided data set consists of five simple laboratory-made samples. Each sample contains different amounts of tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine dissolved in phosphate buffered water. The samples were measured by fluorescence (excitation 250-300 nm, emission 250-450 nm, 1 nm intervals) on a PE LS50B spectrofluorometer. The multiway array $\\mathcal{X}$ to be decomposed is hence $5 \\times 61 \\times 201$. (Bro et al. 1997)\n",
